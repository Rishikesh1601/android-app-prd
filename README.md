# 🤖 Android App PRD & Pre-Build Checklist — Claude Skill

> A reusable Claude AI skill that helps developers create complete Android App PRDs and Google Play Store pre-build checklists — structured, compliant, and ready for release.

---

## What Is This?

This is a **Claude Skill** — a structured instruction file that tells Claude exactly how to behave when you're building an Android app for the Google Play Store.

Instead of prompting Claude from scratch every time you start a new Android project, this skill gives Claude a battle-tested 13-step framework to follow automatically. It understands the full lifecycle: from defining app identity all the way through staged rollout and policy compliance.

---

## What It Does

When this skill is active, Claude will:

- Generate a complete **Android App PRD** (Product Requirements Document)
- Walk you through a **13-section pre-build checklist** before Play Store submission
- Help you declare **Data Safety** accurately in Play Console
- Identify **common rejection reasons** before you hit submit
- Plan a **staged rollout strategy** (Internal → Closed → Production)
- Flag **policy compliance issues** early in the process

---

## The 13-Section Framework

| # | Section | What It Covers |
|---|---------|----------------|
| 1 | App Identity | Name, package name, version code, icon |
| 2 | Platform Configuration | Min SDK, target SDK, keystore, build config |
| 3 | Permissions Planning | Required permissions with justified use |
| 4 | Data & Privacy | Privacy policy, encryption, data inventory |
| 5 | Mandatory Screens | Privacy, support, account deletion, about |
| 6 | Google Play Data Safety | Play Console data declaration |
| 7 | App Stability | Crash-free baseline, offline handling, error recovery |
| 8 | Ads & Monetization | Ad compliance, placement strategy |
| 9 | Play Store Assets | Icon, feature graphic, screenshots specs |
| 10 | Review Access | Test account credentials for reviewers |
| 11 | Build & Signing | AAB generation, keystore signing, ProGuard |
| 12 | Release Flow | Internal → Closed → Production rollout |
| 13 | Policy Compliance | Copyright, impersonation, content rating, IARC |

---

## Who Is This For?

- **Solo developers** launching Android apps on the Play Store
- **Freelancers** managing client Android projects
- **Small teams** who want a standardized pre-release process
- **AI-native engineers** using Claude as a core part of their dev workflow

---

## How to Use

### Option 1: Claude.ai Skills (Recommended)

1. Clone or download this repo
2. Upload `SKILL.md` to your Claude Skills directory
3. Claude will automatically recognize when you need Android PRD help and follow the 13-step framework

### Option 2: Manual Prompt

Copy the content of `SKILL.md` and paste it into any Claude conversation as a system-level instruction. Then ask:

```
Help me create an Android App PRD for my app [App Name]. It does [brief description].
```

Claude will take it from there — section by section.

## Output Example

After running this skill, Claude generates a structured PRD like:

```markdown
# MyApp - Android App PRD

## 1. App Identity
- App Name: MyApp
- Package Name: com.mycompany.myapp
- Version: 1.0.0 (Code: 1)

## 2. Platform Configuration
- Min SDK: API 24 (Android 7.0)
- Target SDK: API 35

## 3. Permissions
| Permission | Justification |
|-----------|---------------|
| INTERNET | API calls |
| CAMERA | Photo capture feature |

...and so on through all 13 sections
```

## Quick Validation Checklist

Before hitting submit on Play Store, this skill also provides a final checklist:

- [ ] Version code incremented
- [ ] Target SDK meets current Google Play requirement
- [ ] All 13 sections addressed
- [ ] AAB signed and locally tested
- [ ] Privacy Policy live and accessible
- [ ] Data Safety form accurate
- [ ] Zero crashes in internal testing
- [ ] Debug logs removed from release build
- [ ] Test account credentials provided
- [ ] Release notes written

---

## Common Pitfalls Covered

| Pitfall | Impact | Solution |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Mismatched version code | Build rejection | Always increment; test locally first |
| Outdated Target SDK | Immediate rejection | Update yearly per Google requirements |
| Missing Privacy Policy | Rejection | Host on accessible domain; verify link |
| Inaccurate Data Safety | App removal risk | Triple-check declarations |
| Crashes in review | Auto-rejection | Test on minimum SDK device |
